# Credit-Card-Generator-GUI
GUI+Credit Card Generator for testing purposes. THIS SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR FRAUDELENT PURPOSE i.e. credit card fraud and I will not take any responsibility if this script I made, is used to harm others or is illegal under your state.

Btw this is a quick script I coded in like 5 minutes so don't complain

# Using it
Pretty ez ngl :)
Edit: Now we don't have to use the MEGA :) It's even more self-explanatory since I made it so it imports the file into the python programme so you don't have to worry about anything to be honest. Now all you gotta do it download the zip file unzip it and run the programme which is 'GUI'. Don't worry about the rest.

# Some explanation to as to how it works
So basically the GUI is really easy and all it uses is tkinter. The credit card gen is also quite easy and it makes use of random module and I use BIN(Bank Identification Lists) and the Luhn's algorithm(ggl it if u dont know what it is) to generate a valid cc that would theoretically work in checkout systems.
